## Setup

`npm install`

Copy the contents of `vendor/react-router` into `node_modules/react-router`.
Overwrite the folders. We need the react-router **master** branch (should be fixed
  soon when react-router releases the next minor version)  

#### Development

`grunt serve:dev`


#### production

`grunt build`
`grunt serve:prod`
